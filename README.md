## Shiny_App


This is the code for building a shiny app based on the mid term questions in a coding based course. It is a tool that any student who has taken this course could use to identify which assignments and course material they should visit in case they did poorly on even specific questions. It is one of the very succeful tools being used by many of us to link back to our past assignments and course materials.
